# theme switcher

this is an adaptation of a **very** old project I created when color-scheme was not yet natively supported by all devices/browsers.

basically, it's the most "efficient" way to use a theme switcher, allowing the user to choose between light theme, dark theme and the theme of their device.

> you can better understand the logic behind this little utility reading [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme)
